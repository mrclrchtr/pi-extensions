# Capability: lsp-tool-guidance

## Purpose
TBD

## Requirements

### Requirement: LSP tool prompt visibility
The system SHALL register the `lsp` tool with a `promptSnippet` and `promptGuidelines` that make semantic navigation discoverable in pi's default system prompt.

#### Scenario: Tool guidance appears in the default prompt
- **WHEN** the `lsp` extension is loaded and the `lsp` tool is active
- **THEN** the tool contributes a one-line prompt snippet describing semantic code intelligence capabilities
- **AND** the tool contributes prompt guidelines telling the agent when to use the `lsp` tool

### Requirement: Semantic-first guidance for supported workflows
The `lsp` tool guidance SHALL instruct the agent to prefer `lsp` actions for symbol lookup, definitions, references, document symbols, hover, rename planning, code actions, and diagnostics in supported languages.

#### Scenario: Agent needs symbol-oriented navigation
- **WHEN** the agent is deciding how to inspect a supported source file for definitions, references, symbols, or diagnostics
- **THEN** the prompt guidance tells it to prefer `lsp` over raw shell text search

#### Scenario: Agent needs semantic rename planning
- **WHEN** the agent needs to understand the impact of renaming a symbol in a supported language
- **THEN** the prompt guidance tells it to prefer `lsp` rename or references workflows before manual text search

### Requirement: Guidance SHALL preserve fallback paths
The `lsp` tool guidance SHALL tell the agent to fall back to `bash` or file reads when LSP is unavailable, unsupported for the file type, or the task is plain-text rather than semantic code navigation.

#### Scenario: Unsupported file type
- **WHEN** the agent is working with a file type that has no configured or available LSP server
- **THEN** the prompt guidance allows fallback to non-LSP tools without implying that LSP is required

#### Scenario: Text search outside semantic workflows
- **WHEN** the task is to search docs, config files, string literals, or other non-symbol text patterns
- **THEN** the prompt guidance allows `bash`-based search instead of forcing `lsp`
